## Reflection
These are a set of questions I wanted to answer to further explain why I created the application with the technologies/tools used and some of the challenges that came with it.

## What was the context for this project ?
This is a project built to practice my web technology skills, using `React.js`, `Redux`, `Firebase` and `CSS`. Project goals included using technologies learnt and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

## What did you set out to build ? 
I wanted to build an application that would implement and refine my skills for `React.js` by using components, managing state and using new features such as; React Hooks. As well as using other web technologies/tools like `HTTP requests`, `Redux`, `authentication` and `testing`.  

## Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience ?
One of the main challeneges I had was learning how to use react.js and the other web technologies/tools, in a clean and efficent way by using best practices and managing state efficently. 

## What tools did you use to implement this project ?
The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, Webpack, Firebase, and VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS.
